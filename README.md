# Getting Started with Create React App

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### 'npm start'
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### 'node index.js'
Runs the backend of app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:8000 to connect it to frontend and also to test on various tools like postman.

Further on all the dockerfiles are also attatched to it in order to containerize the application for both backend(server) and frontend(client).

Also in order to further develop and test other functions docker compose file is also attatched which will run all the three containers which are frontend,backend and database(MongoDB).

Feel free to add improvements and also to tell me about my errors and mistakes

Thank you
